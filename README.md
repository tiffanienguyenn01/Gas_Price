# Gas Price Analysis and Prediction Project
In this project, I dive into historical gas price data using R, working with packages like tidyverse, forecast, and vars to explore how prices have varied over time. The goal is not only to identify trends and build a predictive model with around 95% accuracy using multivariate time series analysis, but also to better understand the factors behind price changes. Along the way, I test specific hypotheses about gas price behavior, apply ANOVA to compare different time periods, and use logistic regression to model the likelihood of sudden price spikes. Through this combination of techniques, the project aims to provide both meaningful insights into past pricing patterns and a practical tool for forecasting future fluctuations.
